# jararaca
Just another snake game - made purely in Python.

I mostly wanted to use it as refresher for basic game-development concepts, in general, and to test the viability of developing games and simple animations in Python, in particular.

## Tentative TODOs:
- [x] add a initial screen (e.g., with "Press any arrow key to start")
- [x] death/game-over ~~animation~~/message with final score
- [x] add food sprites (instead of using basic drawing primitves)
- [ ] menu to configure variables: speed, grid size, etc.
- [ ] add obstacles (e.g. randomly generated), and re-optimize food generation
- [ ] maybe: add different snake and food models, and make them selectable
- [x] maybe: optimize generation and positioning of food
- [ ] maybe: write a proper death animation
